[How to clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)

You will find an index.html, all your work should be in this file.

## Exercise concept

Let's put our skills to test using __JavaScript__!! This will be the focus of the exercise. Some other things like styling, responsivness, etc, are not a must, but will be taken into consideration if you add them. Feel free to use any framework, library, or just plain JavaScript. The decision is yours!

## What is it about?

We want you to create a Web app that gets data from an API and shows it to the user. Also, some functionality needs to be provided too!

## Topic?

![think](assets/think.gif)

After a lot of thinking we realized that it would be great to work with something known by most of us, and the answer was clear: __BEER__.
Luckily, we _do_ know a public API about this topic, called [PUNK API](https://punkapi.com). The website has the necessary documentation to work with it.

## App needs

Using the data from the provided API, we need the Web app to:

* Display a list of 10 beers with their ibu and ph. No sorting criteria needed.
* Display a button to show a custom error. To do that, make an API call to an unexisting endpoint, catch the error and show your custom message.
